# GitFit
An open source solution to macro nutrient tracking, weight monitoring, and informed nutritional decision making. I am learning how to use GitHub and develop in the process so I am completely open to any help/tips. This isn't a school project I  just enjoy nutrition and fitness and I'm tired of paying a subscription for nutrition trackers.
